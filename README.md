## How It Works

Pixeldrain enforces its download limit based on the user's IP address. This project uses Cloudflare Workers as a distributed proxy network.

1.  A user submits a Pixeldrain URL to the main worker.
2.  The worker fetches file metadata (like the original filename) from Pixeldrain's API.
3.  It then generates new download links that point to other deployed proxy workers.
4.  When the user clicks the new link, the request goes through a proxy worker. Pixeldrain sees the worker's IP, not the user's, thus bypassing the personal download limit.

This is **how to bypass the Pixeldrain limit** effectively and reliably.

## Deployment

You can deploy your own version of this **Pixeldrain download tool** for personal use.

1.  **Get a Cloudflare Account**: Sign up for a free Cloudflare account.
2.  **Create Workers**:
    *   Create a main Worker for the user interface (e.g., `pixeldrain-main`).
    *   Create one or more proxy Workers for handling downloads (e.g., `pdb01`, `pdb02`). You will need to set them up on your own domains/subdomains.
3.  **Deploy the Code**:
    *   Paste the code from `worker.js` into your main Worker (`pixeldrain-main`).
    *   **Crucially, you must create a separate proxy worker script** (a simplified version that only handles the `/download/` path and streams the file) and deploy it to your subdomains.
    *   Update the `subDomains` array in `worker.js` to point to your deployed proxy worker URLs.
4.  **Done**: Access your main worker's URL to start using your private **Pixeldrain unlimited downloader**.
